# VGG-TensorFlow
VGGNet re-implement with TensorFlow.

## The purpose of this project
Focus on the structure of the project, The current code can be properly trained. Next I will continue to improve the readability of the code and the structure of the project will also improve the accuracy of the VGG network training.

## Current situation
This repository will use object-oriented programming as much as possible to make the machine learning code structure clearer. So far I have implemented data loader and processing configuration classes and implemented VGG16 network class. In addition, the current code can be visualized using tensorboard.

- [x] data loader
- [x] config file
- [x] base network class
- [x] vgg16 network class
- [x] tensorboard
- [x] test code

## Usage

### Dataset
This repository will support data in a variety of formats. Please inherit `Dataloader` class, write the import module of the dataset you need.

#### CIFAR10 Binary Dataset 
Up to now it supports CIFAR10 data read in binary format.

In order to ensure the correct training, please organize the structure of the data as follows.
```
data
├── datasets
│   └── cifar-10-batches-bin
└── imagenet_models
    └── vgg16.npy
```

cifar-10-batches-bin: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-binary.tar.gz

vgg16.npy: https://mega.nz/#!YU1FWJrA!O1ywiCS2IiOlUCtCpI6HTJOMrneN-Qdv3ywQP5poecM

### get .pbtxt file
don't need to download the dataset and the pretrain model
```bash
python getpb.py
```

### Training
All configuration of data and training can be modified in the file. Use the more readable yaml file format as the configuration file.

For more details, please refer to `experiments/configs/vgg16.yaml`

Simply run this script:
```bash
python ./training.py
```
Recommend using python virtual environment to train.

### Test
Simply run this script to view the detail of arguments:
```bash
python ./test.py --help
```
To test image please run
```bash
python ./test.py --im <your_image_path>
```
You can modify the checkpoint path im `experiments/configs/vgg16.yaml`, please reference `TEST.MODEL_PATH` for more detail.

### graph
Please notice that the current Tensorboard shows that Graph is not beautified. Due to the low version of TensorFlow, using variable_scope when loading pre-trained weights will cause the creation of duplicate variable_scope. If you need to beautify Graph, please select a version of `tensorflow >=1.6.0` or use a temporary hack as below:
```python
def load_with_skip(self, data_path, session, skip_layer):
    data_dict = np.load(data_path, encoding='latin1').item()  # type: dict
    for key in data_dict.keys():
        if key not in skip_layer:
            with tf.variable_scope(self.scope[key], reuse=True) as scope:
                with tf.name_scope(scope.original_name_scope):
                    for subkey, data in zip(('weights', 'biases'), data_dict[key]):
                        session.run(tf.get_variable(subkey).assign(data))
```

If your `tensorflow >=1.6.0`, please notice the solution in the current `vgg16.py` file, that is, use `auxiliary_name_scope=False` as the default parameter.
